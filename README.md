# Modern JavaScript Fetch() Concept <br>
This weather app is build in modern JavaScript, so the funtcions and techniques used in building this projects are also advance.
The fetch() function is used in this project which basically works with the API keys, fetch all the data from the API and provides us a facility to use that data anywhere in our program. API keys are handled by endpoints and used with applications and website interfaces usually referred to as projects by software developers. The keys are not as secure as the authentication tokens, but they do provide a layer of security in that they can identify the project behind a call.
The then() function is used for the purpose to check the response of the fetched data.If the response is true then then() function store the information in a variable.
The catch () method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only. It behaves the same as calling Promise.prototype.then (undefined, onRejected) (in fact, calling obj.catch (onRejected) internally calls obj.then (undefined, onRejected)).
